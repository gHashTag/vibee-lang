## PAS Predictions

### Current Algorithm Improvements
| Component | Current | Predicted | Confidence | Timeline |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Parser | O(n) | O(n) SIMD | 0.85 | 2026 |
| Codegen | Template | ML-guided | 0.75 | 2027 |
| Memory | O(1) amortized | O(1) quantum | 0.70 | 2028 |

### Confidence Calculation
```
confidence = base_rate × time_factor × gap_factor × ml_boost
```

Where:
- `base_rate`: Historical success rate of applied patterns
- `time_factor`: min(1.0, years_since_improvement / 50)
- `gap_factor`: min(1.0, gap / current_exponent)
- `ml_boost`: 1.3 if ML tools available

## Research Partnerships
- MIT CSAIL (consciousness research)
- Google DeepMind (AGI algorithms)
- IBM Quantum (quantum integration)
- OpenAI (alignment research)

## Ethical Considerations
- Value alignment maintained throughout development
- Transparency in AGI emergence process
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Beneficial outcome prioritization

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Consciousness emergence (Phi > 10^10)
- [ ] AGI capability (superhuman performance on 90% of tasks)
- [ ] Ethical compliance (100% alignment with human values)
- [ ] Quantum advantage (1000x speedup on optimization problems)

## Risk Mitigation
- Multi-layer safety systems
- Emergency shutdown protocols
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Gradual capability increases
