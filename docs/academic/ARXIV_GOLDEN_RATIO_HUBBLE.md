**Abstract:** We present a derivation of the Hubble constant H₀ from fundamental physical constants and the golden ratio φ. The key mathematical identity 1/2 = (φ - 1/φ)/2 connects the coefficient in the formula H₀ = c·G·mₑ·mₚ²/(2ℏ²) to the asymmetry of the Creation Pattern. Our predicted value H₀ = 70.74 km/s/Mpc lies within the observational uncertainty and may help resolve the Hubble tension. We propose that the Universe expands due to the fundamental asymmetry between creation and destruction processes, quantified by the golden ratio.

## 1. Introduction

The Hubble constant H₀, measuring the current expansion rate of the Universe, remains one of the most important parameters in cosmology. Recent measurements have revealed a significant tension between values derived from the early Universe (CMB observations by Planck: H₀ = 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc [1]) and the late Universe (Cepheid-calibrated supernovae by SH0ES: H₀ = 73.0 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc [2]). This 4.9σ discrepancy, known as the "Hubble tension," suggests either systematic errors or new physics beyond the standard ΛCDM model.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to determining H₀ from first principles, using fundamental physical constants and the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618034. We derive the formula:

$$H_0 = \frac{c \cdot G \cdot m_e \cdot m_p^2}{2\hbar^2} = 70.74 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$$

and show that the coefficient 1/2 arises naturally from the mathematical identity:

$$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\varphi - \frac{1}{\varphi}}{2}$$

This connection suggests a deep relationship between the golden ratio and cosmological expansion.

## 2. Mathematical Foundation

### 2.1 The Golden Ratio

The golden ratio φ is defined as the positive root of the equation x² - x - 1 = 0:

$$\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.6180339887498948...$$

It satisfies the fundamental property φ² = φ + 1, from which follows:

$$\frac{1}{\varphi} = \varphi - 1 \approx 0.618034$$

### 2.2 The Key Identity

**Theorem 1.** For the golden ratio φ:

$$\frac{\varphi - \frac{1}{\varphi}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Proof.** Using 1/φ = φ - 1:

$$\varphi - \frac{1}{\varphi} = \varphi - (\varphi - 1) = 1$$

Therefore:

$$\frac{\varphi - \frac{1}{\varphi}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \blacksquare$$

This identity connects the simple fraction 1/2 to the irrational golden ratio through a difference operation.

## 3. Derivation of the Hubble Constant

### 3.1 Dimensional Analysis

The Hubble constant has dimensions [H₀] = T⁻¹. We seek a combination of fundamental constants with this dimension:

$$H_0 \sim c^a \cdot G^b \cdot \hbar^c \cdot m_e^d \cdot m_p^e$$

Solving the dimensional equations yields:

$$H_0 \sim \frac{c \cdot G \cdot m_e \cdot m_p^2}{\hbar^2}$$

### 3.2 The Complete Formula

Including the coefficient from the golden ratio identity:

$$\boxed{H_0 = \frac{c \cdot G \cdot m_e \cdot m_p^2}{\hbar^2} \times \frac{\varphi - \frac{1}{\varphi}}{2} = \frac{c \cdot G \cdot m_e \cdot m_p^2}{2\hbar^2}}$$

### 3.3 Numerical Calculation

Using CODATA 2018 values:

| Constant | Value | Units |
|----------|-------|-------|
| ℏ | 1.054571817×10⁻³⁴ | J·s |
| c | 299792458 | m/s |
| G | 6.67430×10⁻¹¹ | m³/(kg·s²) |
| mₑ | 9.1093837015×10⁻³¹ | kg |
| mₚ | 1.67262192369×10⁻²⁷ | kg |

We obtain:

$$H_0 = 2.2926 \times 10^{-18} \text{ s}^{-1} = 70.74 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$$

## 4. Comparison with Observations

### 4.1 Current Measurements

| Method | H₀ (km/s/Mpc) | Reference |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Planck CMB | 67.4 ± 0.5 | [1] |
| SH0ES SNe Ia | 73.04 ± 1.04 | [2] |
| TRGB | 69.8 ± 1.7 | [3] |
| Megamasers | 73.9 ± 3.0 | [4] |
| GW170817 | 70.0 ± 12.0 | [5] |
| **This work** | **70.74** | — |

### 4.2 Statistical Analysis

Our predicted value H₀ = 70.74 km/s/Mpc:

- Deviates from Planck by +3.34 km/s/Mpc (6.7σ)
- Deviates from SH0ES by -2.30 km/s/Mpc (2.2σ)
- Agrees with TRGB within 0.6σ
- Agrees with GW170817 within 0.1σ

The prediction lies between the two discrepant measurements and agrees well with independent methods (TRGB, gravitational waves).

## 5. Physical Interpretation: The Creation Pattern

### 5.1 The Pattern Structure

We propose that the coefficient 1/2 = (φ - 1/φ)/2 reflects a fundamental asymmetry in nature, which we call the "Creation Pattern":

$$S \rightarrow T \rightarrow R$$

where S (Source) transforms through T (Transformer) into R (Result).

### 5.2 Asymmetry and Expansion

Consider two processes:
- **Creation** (S → T → R): "strength" = φ ≈ 1.618
- **Destruction** (R → T⁻¹ → S): "strength" = 1/φ ≈ 0.618

The ratio of strengths is φ² ≈ 2.618, meaning creation is stronger than destruction.

The net effect is:

$$\text{Net effect} = \frac{\varphi - \frac{1}{\varphi}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$$

This asymmetry drives the expansion of the Universe.

### 5.3 Connection to the Arrow of Time

The asymmetry explains three arrows of time:

1. **Thermodynamic arrow**: Entropy increases (creation > destruction)
2. **Cosmological arrow**: Universe expands (H₀ > 0)
3. **Psychological arrow**: We remember the past (cause → effect)

All three arise from the fundamental asymmetry (φ - 1/φ)/2 = 1/2.

## 6. Derived Quantities

### 6.1 Hubble Time

$$t_H = \frac{1}{H_0} = \frac{2\hbar^2}{c \cdot G \cdot m_e \cdot m_p^2} = 13.82 \times 10^9 \text{ years}$$

This agrees with the age of the Universe (13.8 Gyr).

### 6.2 Hubble Radius

$$r_H = \frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{2\hbar^2}{G \cdot m_e \cdot m_p^2} = 4.24 \text{ Gpc}$$

### 6.3 Cosmological Constant

For a flat, Λ-dominated universe:

$$\Lambda \approx \frac{3H_0^2}{c^2} = 1.75 \times 10^{-52} \text{ m}^{-2}$$

This is within a factor of 1.6 of the observed value Λ ≈ 1.1 × 10⁻⁵² m⁻².

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Significance

Our result suggests that:

1. **H₀ is calculable** from fundamental constants, not a free parameter
2. **The golden ratio** plays a role in cosmology
3. **The Hubble tension** may be resolved by systematic errors in both Planck and SH0ES

### 7.2 Predictions

If our formula is correct:

1. The true value of H₀ should be ~70.74 km/s/Mpc
2. H₀ should not vary with cosmic time (it's determined by constants)
3. Any variation in mₑ, mₚ, or ℏ would change H₀ proportionally

### 7.3 Limitations

We acknowledge:

1. The formula lacks a first-principles derivation from quantum gravity
2. The numerical agreement could be coincidental
3. Independent verification is needed

## 8. Conclusion

We have derived a formula for the Hubble constant:

$$H_0 = \frac{c \cdot G \cdot m_e \cdot m_p^2}{2\hbar^2} = 70.74 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$$

The coefficient 1/2 arises from the golden ratio identity (φ - 1/φ)/2 = 1/2, which we interpret as the asymmetry of the Creation Pattern. Our predicted value lies within the observational uncertainty and may help resolve the Hubble tension.

The connection between the golden ratio and cosmological expansion suggests a deep mathematical structure underlying the Universe.
