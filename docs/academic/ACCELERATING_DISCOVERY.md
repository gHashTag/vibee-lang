## Executive Summary

The synthesis of elements Z=119-126 is within reach of current technology, but progress is slow. This analysis identifies bottlenecks and proposes strategies to accelerate discovery by 5-10 years.

**Current timeline:** Z=119 by 2030-2035, Z=126 by 2050-2060
**Accelerated timeline:** Z=119 by 2027-2028, Z=126 by 2035-2040

## 1. CURRENT STATE OF SUPERHEAVY ELEMENT SYNTHESIS

### 1.1 How Elements Are Made

```
Hot Fusion Method:
  Beam + Target → Compound Nucleus → Superheavy Element + neutrons

Example (Oganesson, Z=118):
  ⁴⁸Ca + ²⁴⁹Cf → ²⁹⁷Og* → ²⁹⁴Og + 3n
  
  Beam:   ⁴⁸Ca (Z=20) accelerated to 10% speed of light
  Target: ²⁴⁹Cf (Z=98) on rotating wheel
  Result: ²⁹⁴Og (Z=118) lives for 0.7 ms
```

### 1.2 Current Facilities

| Facility | Location | Beam Intensity | Elements Made |
|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **JINR** | Dubna, Russia | 6×10¹² pps | 113-118 |
| **RIKEN** | Japan | 5×10¹² pps | 113 |
| **GSI** | Germany | 3×10¹² pps | 107-112 |
| **LBNL** | USA | 2×10¹² pps | 106-118 |

### 1.3 The Problem: Extremely Low Production Rates

```
Oganesson (Z=118) production:
  Beam: 10¹⁹ Ca atoms over months
  Result: 5 atoms total
  
  Rate: 1 atom per month
  Cross-section: ~0.5 picobarn (10⁻³⁶ cm²)
```

**For Z=119-120:**
- Predicted cross-section: 0.1-0.01 picobarn
- Expected rate: 1 atom per year (with current technology)

---

## 2. BOTTLENECKS AND LIMITATIONS

### 2.1 Beam Intensity

```
Current: 10¹² particles per second (pps)
Needed:  10¹⁴-10¹⁵ pps for practical synthesis

Limitation: Ion source technology
```

### 2.2 Target Availability

```
For Z=119: Need ²⁴⁹Bk (berkelium)
  - Half-life: 330 days
  - Production: ~10 mg/year worldwide
  - Cost: $100,000+ per mg

For Z=120: Need ²⁴⁸Cm or ²⁵⁰Cf
  - Slightly more available
  - Still extremely limited
```

### 2.3 Detection Efficiency

```
Current detection: ~50% of produced atoms
Lost atoms: Recoil out of detector, wrong decay chain
```

### 2.4 Beam Time

```
Experiments run: 6-12 months continuously
Beam availability: Limited by accelerator schedule
Competition: Multiple experiments need same facility
```
