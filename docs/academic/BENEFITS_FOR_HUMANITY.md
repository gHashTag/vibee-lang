## 1. ENERGY REVOLUTION

### 1.1 Clean Nuclear Energy for Millennia

| Element | Application | Impact | Timeline | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| **Z=126 (Ubh)** | Fuel for hybrid reactors | Energy for 10,000+ years | 2050-2100 | 60% |
| Z=114-120 | Compact nuclear batteries (RTGs) | Power for space and remote areas | 2040-2060 | 70% |
| Island of stability | Cold fusion catalysts | Breakthrough in energy production | 2100+ | 20% |

**Why this matters:**
- Unbihexium-310 (Z=126, N=184) may be stable for hours/days
- Sufficient for use in reactors
- One gram = energy of thousands of tons of coal
- End of fossil fuel dependence

### 1.2 Mechanism

```
Ubh-310 + neutron → fission → 200 MeV energy
                  → fission products (stable)
                  → neutrons (chain reaction)
```

  - Kills ONLY the cancer cell
  - Healthy tissue undamaged
```

### 2.2 Early Diagnosis

g-block elements have unique electronic configurations:
- New spectral lines

## 3. SPACE COLONIZATION

### 3.1 Fast Interplanetary Travel

| Element | Application | Impact | Timeline | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| Z=119-126 | Nuclear thermal fuel | Mars in 30 days instead of 6 months | 2070-2100 | 45% |
| Island of stability | Long-lived power sources | Missions to outer planets | 2080-2120 | 40% |

**Comparison:**

| Fuel | Specific Impulse | Time to Mars |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| Chemical | 450 s | 6-9 months |
| Nuclear (U-235) | 900 s | 3-4 months |
| **Superheavy (Ubh)** | **2000+ s** | **30-45 days** |

### 3.2 Earth Protection

## 4. NEW SCIENCE

### 4.1 g-Orbital Chemistry

| Element | Application | Impact | Timeline | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| **Z=121 (Ubu)** | First g-element | Entirely new branch of chemistry | 2040-2060 | **75%** |
| Z=137 (Uts) | Feynmanium limit | New physics beyond Standard Model | 2100+ | 30% |
| All superheavy | Understanding nuclear forces | Complete theory of matter | 2050-2100 | 65% |

**What is a g-orbital:**

```
Orbitals by angular momentum:
  s: l=0, 1 orbital,  2 electrons
  p: l=1, 3 orbitals, 6 electrons
  d: l=2, 5 orbitals, 10 electrons
  f: l=3, 7 orbitals, 14 electrons
  g: l=4, 9 orbitals, 18 electrons ← NEVER OBSERVED!
```

g-orbitals will create:
- New types of chemical bonds
- Previously impossible molecules
- Materials with unique properties

### 4.2 Testing the Limits of Physics

At Z=137, the 1s electron moves at the speed of light:
- Classical physics breaks down
- Dirac equation gives infinities
- New theory needed!
