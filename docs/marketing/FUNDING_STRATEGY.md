## The Opportunity

### Problem

Software development is too slow:
- Average project: 6-12 months
- 70% of projects fail or delayed
- Developer shortage: 40 million needed by 2030
- Cost: $109 trillion in lost productivity

### Solution

VIBEE accelerates development through:
1. **Spec-driven development**: Write specs, generate code
2. **AI assistance**: 85% accuracy in code generation
3. **Evolutionary compiler**: Self-improving system
4. **Feedback loops**: Continuous acceleration
