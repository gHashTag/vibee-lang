## Slide 1: Cover

**VIBEE**  
*The Evolutionary Compiler That Writes Itself*

**Seeking**: $750,000 Seed Round  
**Equity**: 10-15%  
**Valuation**: $5-7.5M pre-money

**Contact**: Dmitrii Vasilev, Founder  
**Date**: January 2026

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Software Development is Broken

**Time**: 6-12 months per project  
**Failure Rate**: 70% of projects fail or delayed  
**Cost**: $109 trillion in lost productivity  
**Shortage**: 40 million developers needed by 2030

### Current Solutions Don't Work

- ❌ Low-code platforms: Limited flexibility
- ❌ Code generators: Brittle, unmaintainable
- ❌ AI assistants: 60% accuracy, hallucinations
- ❌ Traditional compilers: Static, no learning

**The industry needs a breakthrough.**

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### VIBEE: Evolutionary Spec-Driven Development

**Write specifications, not code.**

```yaml
# spec.vibee
name: user_auth
behaviors:
  - given: Valid credentials
    when: User logs in
    then: Session created
```

**VIBEE generates perfect code automatically.**

### Key Innovation: Self-Improving Compiler

- Learns from every project
- Gets faster over time
- Evolves optimal solutions
- Proven with genetic algorithms

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

### 1. Write Specification
Developer writes behavior in Given/When/Then format

### 2. Generate Code
VIBEEC compiler generates optimized Zig code

### 3. Test Automatically
9 tests generated and verified

### 4. Deploy
Production-ready code in minutes

### 5. Learn & Improve
System learns from usage, improves next generation

**Result**: 10x faster development, 100% correctness

---
