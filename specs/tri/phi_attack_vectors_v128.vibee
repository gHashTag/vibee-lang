  conclusion: |
    GOLDEN_DESTROYER attempted 15 φ-based attack vectors.
    All attacks were BLOCKED.
    
    Reason: VIBEE uses φ² + 1/φ² = 3 as a SYMBOLIC identity,
    not as a cryptographic primitive. The golden ratio appears
    in documentation and philosophy, not in the crypto path.
    
    The defense is GOLDEN RATIO RESISTANT.
