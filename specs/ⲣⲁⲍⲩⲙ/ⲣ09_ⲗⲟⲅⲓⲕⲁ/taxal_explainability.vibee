  TAXAL provides triadic fusion of explainability:
  1. Cognitive: User understanding (can they comprehend?)
  2. Functional: Practical utility (does it help?)
  3. Causal: Faithful reasoning (why this decision?)
  
  Role-sensitive explanations for different stakeholders.

  - name: generate_cognitive_explanation
    given: AI decision
    when: User needs to understand
    then: Comprehensible explanation generated

        }
        expected: { 
          explanation: "This makes your code wait for data without freezing",

        }

  - name: generate_causal_explanation
    given: AI decision
    when: User needs reasoning trace
    then: Faithful causal chain provided
