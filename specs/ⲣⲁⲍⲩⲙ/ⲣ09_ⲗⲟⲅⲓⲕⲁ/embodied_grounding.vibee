  - name: ground_instruction
    given: "Natural language instruction"
    when: "Grounding requested"
    then: "Returns grounded action sequence"
    
  - name: reason_about_scene
    given: "3D scene and query"
    when: "Scene reasoning requested"
    then: "Returns reasoned answer"
    
  - name: execute_grounded_action
