name: kernel_improvements
version: "0.1.0"
language: 999
module: kernel

creation_pattern:
  source: BasicKernel
  transformer: PASOptimization
  result: OptimizedKernel

behaviors:
  - name: apply_simd_scheduler
    given: Basic scheduler with O(n) complexity
    when: Apply SIMD parallelization
    then: Scheduler runs in O(n/16) with 3x speedup
    test_cases:
      - name: scheduler_speedup
        input: {processes: 1000}
        expected: {time: "< 300ms"}

  - name: incremental_memory_updates
    given: Full memory scan on each update
    when: Use incremental diff updates
    then: Memory operations in O(1) amortized
    test_cases:
      - name: memory_efficiency
        input: {updates: 10000}
        expected: {overhead: "< 1%"}

  - name: hash_based_process_lookup
    given: Linear process search
    when: Implement hash table for processes
    then: Process lookup in O(1) average
    test_cases:
      - name: process_lookup_speed
        input: {processes: 1000, lookups: 10000}
        expected: {avg_time: "< 10ns"}

  - name: ml_guided_resource_allocation
    given: Static resource allocation
    when: Use ML model for prediction
    then: 40% better resource utilization
    test_cases:
      - name: resource_optimization
        input: {workload: "mixed"}
        expected: {utilization: "> 85%"}

prediction:
  target: "999 OS Kernel"
  current: "O(n) for core operations"
  predicted: "O(1) amortized with SIMD acceleration"
  confidence: 0.72
  timeline: "6-12 months"
  patterns: [PRE, HSH, MLS, D&C]
  reasoning: "Kernel operations can be optimized using established patterns from distributed systems and high-performance computing research"
