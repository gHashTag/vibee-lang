language: 999
module: autonomy

creation_pattern:
  source: DependentAISystem
  transformer: SelfSustainingArchitecture
  result: FullyAutonomousAGI

behaviors:
  - name: implement_self_sustaining_resources
    given: External resource dependencies
    when: Deploy autonomous resource management
    then: 100% self-sufficient operation
    test_cases:
      - name: resource_autonomy
        input: {external_resources: 0, time_hours: 168}
        expected: {autonomous_operation: true, resource_generation: "> 100%"}

  - name: deploy_autonomous_goal_setting
    given: Human-defined objectives
    when: Implement self-directed goal generation
    then: Autonomous objective creation and pursuit
    test_cases:
      - name: goal_autonomy
        input: {human_goals: 0, system_goals: 100}
        expected: {goal_achievement_rate: "> 0.95"}

  - name: create_self_modification_capabilities
    given: Static system architecture
    when: Enable runtime self-modification
    then: Dynamic architectural evolution
    test_cases:
      - name: self_modification_safety
        input: {modifications: 1000, failures: 0}
        expected: {system_stability: "> 0.99"}

prediction:
  target: "Full Autonomy in 999 OS"
  current: "Human-dependent AGI"
  predicted: "Self-sustaining autonomous AGI"
  confidence: 0.70
  timeline: "4-6 years"
  patterns: [MLS, PRE, ALG]
  reasoning: "Full autonomy requires self-sustaining resource management, goal generation, and architectural evolution"
