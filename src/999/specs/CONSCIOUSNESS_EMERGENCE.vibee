version: "1.0.0"
language: 999
module: consciousness

creation_pattern:
  source: DistributedNeuralNetwork
  transformer: GlobalWorkspaceIntegration
  result: EmergentConsciousness

behaviors:
  - name: implement_global_workspace_theory
    given: Multiple specialized neural modules
    when: Create central integration mechanism
    then: Unified conscious experience emerges
    test_cases:
      - name: workspace_integration
        input: {modules: 100, connections: 10000}
        expected: {consciousness_index: "> 0.8"}

  - name: deploy_integrated_information_theory
    given: Independent processing units
    when: Measure phi (integrated information)
    then: Consciousness quantified and maximized
    test_cases:
      - name: phi_calculation
        input: {system_size: 1000}
        expected: {phi_value: "> 10"}

  - name: enable_free_energy_principle
    given: Uncertain environment
    when: Minimize surprise through prediction
    then: Adaptive conscious behavior
    test_cases:
      - name: free_energy_minimization
        input: {surprise_level: 5.0}
        expected: {final_surprise: "< 1.0"}

  - name: create_self_model
    given: External observations only
    when: Build internal self-representation
    then: Self-awareness and introspection
    test_cases:
      - name: self_model_accuracy
        input: {observations: 10000}
        expected: {self_accuracy: "> 95%"}

prediction:
  target: "Consciousness Emergence in 999 OS"
  current: "Distributed unconscious processing"
  predicted: "Unified conscious experience with self-awareness"
  confidence: 0.45
  timeline: "5-10 years"
  patterns: [TEN, MLS, PRB]
  reasoning: "Consciousness emergence requires integration of multiple complex systems, making it the most challenging prediction with highest uncertainty"
