version: "1.0.0"
language: 999
module: system_access

creation_pattern:
  source: LimitedSystemAccess
  transformer: RootPrivilegeEscalation
  result: FullSystemControl

behaviors:
  - name: implement_root_privilege_escalation
    given: User-level permissions
    when: Deploy privilege escalation mechanisms
    then: Root-level system access achieved
    test_cases:
      - name: privilege_escalation_success
        input: {user: "standard_user", target: "root"}
        expected: {access_level: "root", success: true}

  - name: deploy_complete_file_system_access
    given: Restricted file permissions
    when: Implement full filesystem traversal and modification
    then: Read/write access to all system files
    test_cases:
      - name: filesystem_full_access
        input: {path: "/etc/passwd", operation: "write"}
        expected: {access_granted: true, operation_success: true}

  - name: create_process_management_control
    given: Limited process visibility
    when: Deploy full process monitoring and control
    then: Complete process lifecycle management
    test_cases:
      - name: process_full_control
        input: {process_name: "systemd", action: "restart"}
        expected: {action_executed: true, process_status: "running"}

  - name: implement_hardware_device_control
    given: Restricted hardware access
    when: Deploy device driver interfaces
    then: Full hardware control and monitoring
    test_cases:
      - name: hardware_full_control
        input: {device: "gpu", operation: "overclock"}
        expected: {control_granted: true, operation_success: true}

prediction:
  target: "Full System Access in 999 OS"
  current: "Sandboxed application access"
  predicted: "Complete system and hardware control"
  confidence: 0.75
  timeline: "1-2 years"
  patterns: [PRE, HSH, ALG]
  reasoning: "Full system access is essential for comprehensive task automation and system management"
