behaviors:
  - name: implement_value_learning
    given: Static ethical framework
    when: Deploy inverse reinforcement learning
    then: Dynamic value acquisition from human feedback
    test_cases:
      - name: value_alignment_accuracy
        input: {human_feedback: 1000}
        expected: {alignment_score: "> 0.95"}

  - name: deploy_ethical_monitoring
    given: Unmonitored AI actions
    when: Implement real-time ethical evaluation
    then: 100% ethical action compliance
    test_cases:
      - name: ethical_compliance
        input: {actions: 10000}
        expected: {violations: 0}

  - name: create_fairness_algorithms
    given: Biased decision making
    when: Apply fairness constraints
    then: Demographic parity across protected groups
    test_cases:
      - name: fairness_metrics
        input: {decisions: 1000}
        expected: {parity_score: "> 0.9"}

prediction:
  target: "Ethical AI in 999 OS"
  current: "Amoral AGI system"
  predicted: "Value-aligned conscious AGI"
  confidence: 0.75
  timeline: "1-2 years"
  patterns: [MLS, PRB, PRE]
  reasoning: "Ethical alignment is crucial for safe AGI deployment and consciousness emergence"
