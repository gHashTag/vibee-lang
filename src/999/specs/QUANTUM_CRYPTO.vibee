    given: ECDSA vulnerable to quantum attacks
    when: Implement XMSS signatures
    then: Quantum-secure digital signatures
    test_cases:
      - name: xmss_signing
        input: {document: "contract", private_key: "key"}
        expected: {signature: valid, quantum_secure: true}

  - name: create_quantum_key_distribution
    given: No quantum key exchange
    when: Implement BB84 protocol
    then: Information-theoretic security
